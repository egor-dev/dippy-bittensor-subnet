# Subnet Token

With the launch of dTAO, every subnet has a token that anyone can buy and sell. 
Given the current dynamics of dTAO and subnet tokens, there is incentive for holders of the subnet to both incentivize demand and manage supply.

## Incentivizing Token Demand

The dippy team has committed to purchase subnet tokens with revenue from the dippy app. What this means is that if the subnet can produce an engaging model that drives demand for the dippy app, ideally that will lead to more demand for the subnet token.

For miners, extended access to the dippy dataset used for fine tuning will be gated by stake in the subnet token. Thus, for miners to be competitive on the subnet, keeping enough reserves of the subnet token will be paramount.

## Token Supply

The subnet has the option to burn miner emissions depending on the quality of the models submitted and their real world performance.
Given the current state of the subnet, the configuration stands at 75% of the miner emissions being burned. The purpose of this burning is twofold: one is to incentivize higher quality of models submitted by lowering burn at a later time, and to better manage the token supply to manage the price.
